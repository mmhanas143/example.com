I made this website for a demo 
# features 

* Glassmorphism Cards: The glass-card class creates a beautiful "glass" effect with a blurred background. This is a very popular and contemporary design trend that gives the cards a premium, sleek look.

  * Aurora Background: The aurora-bg is a great design choice. It's a subtle, animated gradient that constantly shifts in the background. It adds a sense of depth and a futuristic feel without distracting from the main content.

* Gradient Text: You've used the gradient-text class to make the "StoreCraft" logo and the main headline visually dynamic. This technique makes key text elements pop off the page and draws the user's eye.

* * Parallax-like Hero Effect: The JavaScript code on the hero section creates a unique interactive experience. When you move your mouse over the section, the text and button subtly tilt, giving the page a cool 3D effect. It's a small detail that makes the website feel alive.
 
  * * Scroll-Reveal Animations: By using an IntersectionObserver, your site implements smooth scroll-reveal animations. Elements like the headings and cards fade in and slide up as the user scrolls, creating a polished and professional user experience.
